# script name: meta-outliers.py
# 
# In the spirit of release early, release often, here's a script
# that's part of a larger project I'm working on.
#
# What does it do?
# Parses the output from the Sleuth Kit's fls command.
# Either fls -ap or fls -arp or an fls bodyfile. For more information on
# fls, check out Brian Carrier's The Sleuth Kit.
#
# meta-outliers.py goes through the output of fls and returns
# the average metadata address and the standard deviation on
# a per path basis and returns a list of all files that have
# metadata addresses outside the standard deviation for their
# directory. It shows you a list of outliers, hence the name.
#
# "Why should I care?"
#
# You need more useless trivia in your life. This will help.
# At parties you'll say "On my Win7 box the metadata address of my
# SAM file is two standard deviations from normal."
#
# You win.
#
# Alternatively, you may be able to use this to find suspicious
# files in random file systems. But probably not. In my limited
# testing, this does greatly reduce the data set from hundreds
# of thousands of files, to a few thousand or a few hundred.
# But that's still more noise than most people want to deal
# with. So, there's more to come. 
#
# Release early. Release often.
